I am an Executive Management Consultant who has an interest in implementing new technologies and ML into new and existing organisations.

Not a programmer.

I have had little formal experience in 'coding' but like to think that 'automating the boring stuff' will take a lot of life's little hurdles out of one's day to work more efficiently and have time to work on the important decisions that need attention.

My GitHub collection will be ideas that I will work on when I have time or find the motivation to do so.

Happy for anyone to pick up the code and run with it.
